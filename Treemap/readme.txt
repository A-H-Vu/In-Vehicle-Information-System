This project reads the pre-input file, and establishes the corresponding entity class to store the data items corresponding to the data file, and the total data processing is carried out separately in Main.java.
In this project, TreeMap based on red-black tree algorithm is used for data processing, and JavaFX component is used for data display and output, which has a good user interface and data readability.
